<h1>Gold Price Prediction Prediction</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project Overview:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict gold prices based on various financial and market-related indicators. Gold is a key asset in global financial markets, and accurately forecasting its price can provide valuable insights for investors, analysts, and financial institutions.

Problem Statement:
The objective is to predict the future price of gold using historical data and related features such as currency exchange rates, stock market indices, and commodity prices. Given the volatile nature of gold prices, developing a reliable predictive model can support informed investment decisions.

Model Approach:
- <b>Collected a dataset containing historical gold prices and several influencing features</b>
- </b>Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and patterns</b>
- </b>Preprocessed the dataset by: a.Handling missing values and outliers b.Normalizing and transforming features as needed</b> c.Built and tested  machine learning model: </b>
- </b>Selected and trained a Random Forest Regressor model due to its robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships</b>
- </b>Evaluated model performance using metrics </b>



<h2>Skills </h2>

- <b>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</b>
- <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>
- <b>Regression modeling</b>
- <b>Random Forest algorithm</b>
- <b>Feature engineering</b>
- <b>Model evaluation and interpretation</b>

<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- <b>Successfully developed a machine learning model capable of predicting used car prices with high accuracy. This model provides a valuable tool for enhancing pricing transparency and optimizing business operations in the automotive resale market.</b>
